# Regulated-Fluctuations-in-Nanog-Expression
When doing simulation of Fluctuation (Fluc_sim, 0.5sim, 1sim) please change the direction of .psc file./n
Figure 2B is made by phase_plot.py/n
Figure 3A is made by Fluc_sim.py. Change the smod.ChangeParameter('omega',0.2) to get different plots. /n
Figure 4A is made by mult_inte.py/n
Figure 4B is made by Hill_number.py/n
Figure 4C is made by phase_plot.py and changing the parameter p in Regulated_Nanog.py/n
Figure 5A is made by 0.5sim.py/n
Figure 5B is made by 1sim.py/n
